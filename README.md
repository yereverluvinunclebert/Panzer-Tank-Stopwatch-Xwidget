This Panzer widget is an attractive dieselpunk Xwidget for your desktop. 
It is a simple multi-timezone stopwatch and clock. Functional and gorgeous at 
the same time. This Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere 
around the desktop as you require.

The widget can be resized - Hover the cursor over the widget. Press the CTRL key 
and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will resize dynamically.

This widget is a virtual duplicate of the Yahoo widget Panzer Clock widget that 
you can find here: https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-Clock-Ywidget/tree/main
The graphic interface and operation of the two types of widgets are the same. The 
only differences are the configuration preference utility (that is a cut-down 
version) and the engine that is utilied to put the widget on your screen.

This widget is uploaded here for historical archival reasons. I suggest that you 
use the Yahoo widget version as it is a superior engine for developing widgets. 
I will provide bugfixes for the Yahoo widget version but not for Xwidgets.

All Jscript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the XWidget engine. The engine interprets the Jscript and creates the widget 
according to the XML description and using the images you provide.
